Add/remove a single movie:

http://www.imdb.com/list/_ajax/edit

postdata:

{name}:{value} // this is random for every account, see below how to obtain this data
const:tt0000000
list_id: xxxxxxx // unique id for the list
ref_tag: title
action:delete // for a delete action



----

Get name:value for actions
These values are use in the action calls to 'validate' the account
We should obtain these on first load of the script.
Maybe they change every so often then we need to check for these more often.
Mine currently are "value":"0c3*","name":"49e6*"

POSTDATA:
/list/_ajax?watchlist_has
consts[]: tt0000000 // could be any valid ttID

RESPONSE:
json formatted
extra: {"value":xxxx, "name":xxxx}

The api calls for actions no longer need control code for the category ids so we no longer need to save those.
They were currently stored on a per movie per category basis.
movieid-voteint-categoryid:controlid-categoryid2:controlid2-etc
