TODO for 3.0.0 release
------------------------
	
catch add/remove movie via native UI /* if catch is not possible remove element */

Fix parsing Page.initType

Fix link highlighting and pulldowns:
	Resolve issues with multiple links to the same movie. Currently only the first one gets an pulldown menu otherwise there will be problems with duplicate form id's
	Get rid of hardcoded pulldown limit (currently 1000) / activePulldown
	Images get tags and highlight only A tags with movie title should get highlighted
		Perhaps store title in MovieObj to check this.
