TODO for 3.0.0 release
------------------------
Change IMDB.getMovieList to obtain the list_item_id.
	We need to get the paginated html results

catch add/remove movie via native UI

Adding/removing a movie to watchlist needs watchlist_id
	- get the watchlist id from the page

Version checker:
@require version script

Pulldowns:
	Resolve issues with multiple links to the same movie. Currently only the first one gets an pulldown menu otherwise there will be problems with duplicate form id's
	Get rid of hardcoded pulldown limit (currently 1000) / activePulldown
